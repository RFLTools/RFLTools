# RFLTools

AutoLisp RFL Alignment Design Tools and Utilities

Purpose:  Master loader of RFL Tools

Run RunMe.cmd to create loadable lsp file

LoadRFLTools.lsp : Collection of all Available Tools.

Note:  Description of each command is found in the README.md of each subfolder.

Now included is the Visual Studio solution.  If you would like to use you will need to copy the necessary .DLL file(s) from the ...RFLTools_Solution\bin to a searchable and trused folder.  The DLL's are not necessary but will speed up some of the calculations. 

For the solution to compile you will need to create a library folder and gather the following from AutoDesk:

...\Autodesk_Libraries\Autodesk_ObjectARX_2013_Win_64_and_32Bit\...

...\Autodesk_Libraries\Autodesk_ObjectARX_2014_Win_64_and_32Bit\...

...\Autodesk_Libraries\Autodesk_ObjectARX_2015_Win_64_and_32_Bit\...

...\Autodesk_Libraries\Autodesk_ObjectARX_2016_Win_64_and_32_Bit\...

...\Autodesk_Libraries\Autodesk_ObjectARX_2017_Win_64_and_32_Bit\...
