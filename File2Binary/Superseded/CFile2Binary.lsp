     ;;  If the file is successful read the data is returned as 
     ;;  a string. Won't be tripped up by nulls, control chars
     ;;  including ctrl z (eof marker). Pretty fast (feel free 
     ;;  to bench mark / compare to alternates).
     ;;
     ;;  If the caller wants the result as a list of byte values 
     ;;  simply use vl-string->list on the result:
     ;;
     ;;      (setq bytes
     ;;          (if (setq stream (_ReadStream path len))

     ;;      path  <duh>
     ;;      len   Number of bytes to read. If non numeric, less 
     ;;            than 1 or greater than the number of bytes in 
     ;;            the file everything is returned.
